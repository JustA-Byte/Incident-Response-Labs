|       The 5 W's          | **Who caused the incident?** <br>- The incident was caused by a well known organised group of unethical hackers known for targeting healthcare institutes. <br>**What happened?** <br>- Employees were targeted with phishing emails that contained attachments laced with malware. This malware once activated downloaded ransomware files, encrypted the local machine files, including critical patient data, and left a ransomware note on the screen of the local computers. <br> **When did the incident occur?** <br>- Approximately 9am on Tuesday morning. <br> **Where did the incident happen?** <br>- A small US based healthcare clinic specialising in delivering primary-care services. <br> **Why did the incident happen?**<br>- Employees who were targeted unknowingly opened the phishing email attachments which triggered the malware download. The hacking group want to extort the business for money to release access to patient files and data. |
| Additional Notes | The company was forced to shut down their computer systems and contact several organisations to report the incident and receive technical assistance. This means that not only have they suffered a financial cost to this event, there is a reputational damage to consider, damage to customer privacy due to their data being accessed and also general patient care, where patients havenâ€™t been able to be dealt with, they have been left to suffer unnecessarily. |
