## Introduction
I have used the <a href="https://github.com/JustA-Byte/Incident-Response-Labs/blob/main/Phishing%20Incident%20Response%20Playbook.md">Phishing Incident Response Playbook </a> to address the following Phishing email alert.

| Ticket ID | Alert Message | Severity | Details | Ticket Status|
|-----------|--------------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| A-2703    | SERVER-MAIL Phishing attempt possible download of malware| Medium | The user may have opened a malicious email and opened attachments or clicked links. | Escalated|

<br>

| Ticket Comments |
|-----------------|
| VirusTotal shows the attachment file hash as being malicious. The email itself has multiple areas that indicate a phishing attempt: <br>- The email address of the sender doesnâ€™t match the name of the sender and is suspicious. <br>- The subject line begins as a reply
There is a typo in the greeting. <br>- Bad grammar in the body of the message. <br>- The body specifies that there is a resume and cover letter attached, however the attachment is a single executable file. <br>- Escalating the alert to level 2 SOC analysts for further investigation and action as per the playbook process. |
